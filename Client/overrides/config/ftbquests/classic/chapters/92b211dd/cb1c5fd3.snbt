	description: "The linker is your best friend. It connects the rocket to the various infrastructures. Later, you can expand this idea and connect the infrastructures to a docking pad and any rocket using the docking pad will be linked to the infrastructures as well",
	text: [
		"To fuel a rocket you can either bucket the rocket fuel in. A better alternative, is to use a Fueling Station. Once you have the fueling stations set-up and filled with rocket fuel, shift-right-click the fuelling station with the Linker",
		"Then shift-right-click a rocket. If the linked is done successfully, a dotted white line should appear from the fuelling station to the rocket, and the rocket will begin filling with fuel.",
		"As long as that rocket remains built, it will remain connected to linked infrastructure, and in this case, will re-fuel itself upon landing if there is fuel available in the fuelling station."
