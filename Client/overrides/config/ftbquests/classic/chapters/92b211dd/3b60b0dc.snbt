	text: [
		"&oEvery block you put on your rocket has a mass and more mass requires more thrust to escape the planet's gravity well.",
		"&oFuel is required for any rocket transport. Be sure you have enough fuel to make it back home.",
		"&oA successful build requires a balance between mass, thrust, and fuel carrying capability.",
		"&oRockets can only fly between a planet and its moon, or much later, a space station and other planetary beings. A rocket CANNOT transport from planet to planet.",
		"&lA rocket &rcan be built from &lany block&r in the game but must contain a number of &lEngines and Fuel Tanks&r Engines provide thrust, and the number of engines needed is based on the mass. They also consume fuel, which is stored in the fuel tanks.",
		"The \"Dissassemble\" button will convert the rocket back into blocks, but careful, you need a rocket assembling machine to reassemble the rocket again!"
