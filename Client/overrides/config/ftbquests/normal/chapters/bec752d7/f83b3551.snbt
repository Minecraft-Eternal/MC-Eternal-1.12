		"&5Stability Field Generators&7 will use a good chunk of &4Forge Energy (FE, sometimes known as RF, other times CF, IF, or Î¼I)&7 to stabilize a &5Flux Rift&7 it is aimed at.",
		"",
		"The device's activity can be controlled with &cRedstone&7, if powered by &cRedstone&7, it will be paused, if not, it will be active.",
		"",
		"While the device can be left always running, funneling so much raw electricity into a device made of Arcane materials is generally not very functional, so &6the impact of stability recovery is minimal if it is left on&7, and also incredibly energy-inefficient, a clever Thaumaturge without any Technological prowess should only enable it when needed, to allow the internal mechanisms to cool down from the electricity.",
		"",
		"While a &dTimer&7 of some kind to control it is a good idea on paper, some cases such as the Rift simply being too large, or the Stabilizer it firing shortly before a &dRift's size is increased a large amount by some artifical means that would cause instability&7 may lead to the Rift being allowed to become too big and unstable too quickly, allowing it to collapse, likely into &5Taint&7.",
		"",
		"This could probably be used in tandem with a device that can &dMonitor the state of Flux Rifts&7 to make sure that one is returned to pristine stability when it becomes too unstable."
