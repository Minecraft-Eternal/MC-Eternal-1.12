Emergency Note
Dave
H-Hello? If anyone is reading this, please don't try to save me. It's too late! I can already feel the infection ravaging my body and I don't want to hurt anyone else. I beg of you. Stay away! You can't save me and you can't kill me, no matter how much you try. Though I beg Notch give me the grace of death, I feel that only time can mediate my situation. Just tell my love, Jennifer, that I miss her and... I'm sorry for what I have done...
