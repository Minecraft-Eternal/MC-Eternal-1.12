How to Fight: the Ender Dragon
Jammy Lieber
The Ender Dragon may seem menacing, but it isn't all that bad if you are prepared. To the newbie and unprepared, the Ender Dragon will be tough to downright impossible. The Ender Dragon spawns in the "End" dimension. To find the End dimension, one must first find a stronghold. Whatever stronghold you find will most likely contain an End portal somewhere inside its depths. The end portal frames have a unique design of a pedestal like block that is of a yellowish hue. they are in a 5x5 square with the corner pieces removed. To activate the portal, you will need eyes of ender. These are placed inside the end portal frames. One will see a distinguished difference between portal frames with and without an eye of ender inserted in it. Once all twelve portal frames are filled with eyes of ender, the portal to the end is formed. One can then jump into said portal, but beware. Once you enter the only way to get back to the overworld by killing the Ender Dragon. You must be prepared before entering.
Supplies needed to fight the Ender Dragon depend on strategy. The most common way requires these items: a full set of diamond armor (with a high Protection enchantment), a sword with the Sharpness enchantment (Knockback and Fire Aspect do not work on the Ender Dragon), a bow with a high Power enchantment and preferably Infinity (same rules apply above for Punch and Flame), Obviously an arrow (or piles and piles of arrows if you don't have the Infinity), some building blocks, a pickaxe, some instant health II splash potions, some strength II potions, and a few (enchanted) golden apples. You will see how all of these will help in the following combat strategy.
Again, the following strategy is one of the infinitely possible combat strategies there are for fighting the Ender Dragon. Once inside the End, you will most likely spawn in a small room enclosed in end stone, a yellowish stone block much like seen in the end portal frames. You will have to dig yourself up to the surface if this is your case. If this is not your case, then just find the main area of the dimension marked by obsidian pillars and Endermen. Once you reach the main area, you are likely to spot the Ender Dragon at this point. He is a great black, scaly, winged creature with purple eyes. He flies around the dimension in the sky. Along with the Ender Dragon, you will also see numerous Endermen along with crystal-like entities on top of obsidian pillars with varying heights. The first goal is to get rid of every single crystal. These crystals regenerate the Ender Dragon's health. You can get rid of these by sniping them with your bow. If the arrow hits, the crystal will explode. Building block towers to hit them more easily with your bow can be done as well, but be cautioned that you are vulnerable to Ender Dragon attack this way, but if it is necessary, then do it. Keep destroying the crystals until there are none left. This way, when you damage the Ender Dragon, it can't heal. Once you finish destroying said crystals, you are ready to fight. Consume a strength potion and get ready. But wait! What about all those pesky Endermen? If you don't look into them with your crosshairs, you will be fine. Just do your best to ignore them. If you do get attacked, try your best to quickly kill it and continue fighting the Ender Dragon. The Ender Dragon has a unique way of attacking. It will usually idle in the air for a bit. Then it swoops down to you and tries to ram into you. While it is in the air, your only option is your bow and you will be lucky if you can land a hit if he is high. When the Ender Dragon swoops down to attack you, now is your chance to hit him with your bow with more accuracy and even swing at him with your sword if desired. Try to avoid the Ender Dragon's attack by moving out of the way when the Ender Dragon gets close enough. Really, your bow is your weapon of choice but again, the sword can be used in close quarters to dish out some extra damage. Keep repeating this process and heal as necessary and eventually, you can defeat the Ender Dragon. When you do, you will see an animation of the Ender Dragon disintegrating. He will then explode and a portal to the overworld forms under him. He will also drop an incredible amount of experience points. It is enough XP to bring you from level 0 to 60. Also, it should be noted that an Ender Dragon egg sits atop the portal into the overworld. A piston can be used to drop this egg into the item form. This egg can be placed as a trophy. It is proof that you defeated the Ender Dragon!
