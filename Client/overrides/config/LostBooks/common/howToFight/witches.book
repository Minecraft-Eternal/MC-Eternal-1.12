How to Fight: Witches
Stanley Lieber
Witches are almost immune to splash potions of poison and harm. When damaged, they will drink a potion of healing or regeneration, to heal themselves. When drinking a potion, a witch's nose will point straight forward instead of down. When drinking a potion, they can not attack the player for a little over one second. If lit on fire or touching lava, witches will quickly drink a potion of fire resistance, making lava and fire ineffective ways of killing witches.
A bow will likely be the best weapon for dealing with a witch, as the splash potions have only a short range (at most nine blocks) compared to arrows. If a bow is not an option, a direct melee charge is the best option. Due to the witch's slow attack speed, if the player runs in a straight line and manages to get a quick sword strike in, the witch will try to heal itself, leaving the player to attack them without as much fear of retaliation.
When all else fails, turn to your trusty bucket of water and dump it between you and the witch. You will easily be able to make your escape if far enough away from the witch. If the witch is already close, then you will most likely be hit with a couple potions before you escape. Once in safety, you can get back to full health and devise a plot to kill the witch. Always be sure to keep your bucket handy and full of water!
