# Welcome to the MC Eternal Repository
========================

***Note for Adam:***
Make sure to copy the 'classic' folder in the ftbquests config and rename that copy to 'challenge', because editing two quest directories on the repo is extremely annoying.

- Switch to the latest available branch from the Branches dropdown. (Current latest: Beta/v1.4).
